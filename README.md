## **Title:** Pet Dataset Classification and Segmentation

## Abstract:

The goal of this project is to be able to recognise the pets (between cats and dogs) and their breeds based on the data given. We use the very interesting and diverse [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/). The dataset consists of 7384 images, with 37 different breeds of cats and dogs (2371 cats and 4978 dogs). We train the data on 5 different types of models: (i) convolutional neural network, (ii) ensemble convolutional neural network, (iii) Resnet based image classification model (pre-trained with imagenet dataset), (iv) vision transformer (pre-trained with imagenet dataset), and (v) ensemble model based on the pre-trained models (resnet-152, densenet-161 and vgg-19). We trained it using TensorFlow and Keras. The MV2 and Exception model performed the best with an accuracy of about 95%. Where the MV2 model was more consistent. We used the pre-trained model and fit our data onto it. Thus, the system can be used to identify the breed of any cat or dog live. We additionally also tried to predict the bounding boxes on the pets to detect the faces of the pets for classification in a larger frame.

### Introduction:

The problem we are trying to solve is to detect and evaluate the breed of the pet, and whether it is a cat or a dog. This is interesting because it has practical applications beyond being a thought-provoking problem. It can be used at animal shelters for idâ€™ing lost pets, vet clinics for quick screening, or even social media when curating viewing algorithms for users. Additionally, the dataset is large and diverse, making it a benchmark for evaluating deep learning models in the field of computer vision.

To approach this problem, we first built a segmentation model as a baseline to see how it would perform at classifying the dataset. We then created 3 models off of it: ensemble, vision transformer (ViT), and ResNet. These models each have various specifications that they excel in that we proposed would outperform the segmentation model. We came to this conclusion because they are best at extracting features and recognizing patterns in visual data which is the exact goal of our project.

During the early stages of the undertaking when we were researching how to approach the problem and how others had approached similar problems, we saw that there were many previous versions of this problem using regular CNNs. However, there were no previous attempts at this using newer models like ResNet and pre-trained ViT. These state-of-the-art approaches allow us to achieve accuracies that previously would take much larger datasets and much more computational time and power. Additionally, our larger, more diverse models can be combined to create more precise results.

The key components of our approach are the segmentation model as a base, the three other models (ensemble, ViT, and RESNET), and the use of data augmentation techniques to improve the performance of the models. We also combine multiple models in our ensemble learning and improve the accuracy of our predictions. The limitations of our approach include the need for large amounts of training data and the computational resources required to train multiple models.

### Setup

#### 2.1 Dataset Description

The dataset that we used for this project is the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/).

#### 2.2 Experimental setup

#### _2.2.1 Setup_

We cleaned the data and characterized the information into a dataframe so we can analyze and train the data. The data frame includes the image (as an array - tensor), label (cat or dog), breed (one of 37 mentioned above) and the filename.

<img width="714" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-11 at 5 07 45 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56982656/231655863-8f296620-09d9-4300-a652-3411f859254c.png">

We then split the data into the train, test and validation datasets (train: 60, test: 20 and val: 20).

We then defined the base model - CNN with the following architecture:

We created the train and validation generator for the images and fit the model using it.

#### _2.2.2 Models we are going to run_

1. **Convolutional Neural Network:** A deep neural network commonly used for image classification and object recognition tasks, which typically consists of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
2. **Ensemble Convolutional Neural Network:** A combination of multiple convolutional neural networks that work together to improve the accuracy of image classification.
3. **ResNet-based Image Classification Model:** A convolutional neural network architecture that uses residual connections to improve the performance of deep networks for image classification tasks. (The model is pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset, which contains millions of labeled images.)
4. **Vision Transformer:** A neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequential inputs, which has shown impressive performance on various natural language processing tasks. (This model has been pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset for image classification tasks.)
5. **Ensemble Model based on Pre-trained Models:** A combination of multiple pre-trained models including ResNet-152, DenseNet-161, and VGG-19, working together to improve the accuracy of image classification.

#### _2.2.3 Parameters_

We have varied parameters for each model, specifications are visible in the code itself. However, for the base model and the best model the parameters are mentioned below:
**Base Model:**

- **Number of filters:** The number of filters used in each convolutional layer. In this model, the first convolutional layer has 32 filters, the second has 64 filters, and the third and fourth convolutional layers have 128 filters each.
- **Filter size:** The size of the filters used in each convolutional layer. In this model, all the filters have a size of 3x3.
- **Activation function:** The activation function used in each layer. In this model, the ReLU activation function is used for all the convolutional layers and the dense layers, while the softmax activation function is used in the final output layer.
- **Input shape:** The shape of the input images. In this model, the input images are expected to have a shape of 224x224 with 3 color channels (RGB).
- **Number of units:** The number of units in the dense layers. In this model, the dense layer following the flattened output has 512 units, while the final output layer has 2 units.
- **Optimizer:** The optimization algorithm used during the training process. In this model, the RMSprop optimizer is used.
- **Loss function:** The loss function used during the training process. In this model, the binary cross-entropy loss function is used.
- **Metric:** The performance metric used to evaluate the model during the training process. In this model, the 'acc' metric (accuracy) is used.

#### _2.2.4 Computing environment_

We computed and ran it locally through the Jupyter notebook in the folder. However, it can be run through [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [discovery cluster](https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/documentation/) (or any other server).

#### 2.3 Problem setup (Network Architecture)

1. For our convolutional neural network, we used 4 convolutional layers with 32, 64, 128, and 128 layers. We then followed this up with 2 dense layers containing 512 and 2 units. We fed our reshaped images into this model and then received our baseline results.
2. In our Vision Transformer model, we first break down the image into a series of patches. We then flatten these patches into a sequence of vectors that are processed by transformer blocks. This process of breaking down the image into patches and recognizing patterns within these smaller parts is what allows the ViT model to recognize subjects of images even when they have been shifted positionally. The feed-forward network of the transformer blocks then applies non-linear transformation to the mechanism, causing further processing of the feature representation of the image.
3. The ResNet model works slightly differently than the ViT model. The ResNet architecture has several residual blocks containing multiple convolutional layers. The output of these blocks is the sum of its input and the output of the convolutional layers it used. Our ResNet model was also pre-trained on data from the ImageNet dataset and then we tuned the model by adding our own output layers.
4. We also have an ensemble model consisting of multiple CNNs and an ensemble model that is a combination of multiple pre-trained models. Both of these work by doing a majority voting of the output probabilities from each model they are composed of and the most popular choice is the predicted output. This output is then a representation of the best guess of all the models combined.
   1. We also fit these pre-trained models on our dataset (fine-tuning them). These were:
      1. ResNet-152: A deep residual neural network architecture that includes 152 layers, designed to address the vanishing gradient problem during training.
      2. DenseNet-161: A densely connected convolutional neural network architecture that includes 161 layers, where each layer receives feature maps from all preceding layers in a feed-forward fashion.
      3. VGG-19: A convolutional neural network architecture with 19 layers, characterized by its simplicity and uniformity, where each layer has a fixed kernel size of 3x3 and a fixed stride of 1.
      4. IV3 (Inception V3): A deep convolutional neural network architecture that employs a combination of parallel convolutional filters with different kernel sizes to capture features at different scales.
      5. MV2 (MobileNetV2): A lightweight convolutional neural network architecture designed for mobile and embedded vision applications, which uses depth wise separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters and computation.
      6. Exception Model: A deep neural network architecture based on the idea of dynamic routing between capsules, which are groups of neurons that represent the pose and instantiation parameters of an entity in an image.

### Results:

1. This chart shows the different training accuracies and losses for all the models that we trained our dataset on. The MV2 and Exception models perform the best as they provide the highest accuracy most consistently. This is because MobileNetV2 provides higher accuracies through efficient depthwise separable convolutions and other optimization techniques, while Exception Model provides higher accuracies through dynamic routing between capsules, allowing different parts of an image to interact and influence each other.

2. A few attempts at using bounded boxes to capture the body of a cat/dog

3. One of our parameter choices was to resize all inputs images to (224, 224, 3). We made this choice by looking at other similar models and decided that this image shape seemed to be standard. This also allows a smaller input size, and therefore less parameters which means the models we made were computationally efficient to train and less likely to overfit. We then decided to use the ReLu activation function to introduce some non-linearity in our models so it could handle more complex relationships with data. We determined the filter size of 3x3 in our base CNN model based on what seemed to be standard in other models. We also tried varying the number of filters in each layer to see the impact it would have on our model. The loss function we found most appropriate was the binary cross entropy loss since this was a classification problem with two outcomes.
4. We additionally, also looked at the training and validation loss and accuracy with the CNN to get the classification on the 37 classes of the breeds.

### Discussion:

The results of the pretrained Resnet models are fairly accurate with validation accuracy ranging from .6 to .75. Some existing approaches for image classification of dogs and cats is the Asirra CAPTCHA which uses a combination of support-vector machine classifiers trained on input images. This existing approach has an accuracy of 82.7% and specifically focused on the color and texture features of images.

The results of the Vision Transformer model were also fairly accurate with accuracy of about .65 and loss of about .6. This pretrained model might benefit from
The results of the ensemble model created from three CNNs and the other ensemble model created from three pretrained image classifications models are both very poor and performed worse than expected. There might be a problem where the model is overfit on the training data and once the ensemble model tries to combine the predictions of the underlying models on the testing data, it falls apart and canâ€™t accurately predict the label of the testing data.

The results of the pretrained model MV2 and Xception model on their own are very good, however, as mentioned before since the ensemble made of these models does very poorly on the testing data, it is likely that these models are overfit and not as accurate as the training and validation accuracy would portray.

The results of the 37 classes of breed prediction was a very difficult problem to solve, especially with the convolutional neural network giving us an accuracy of being in between about 2.5% and about 5%. This makes sense because there are a lot of breeds we could classify into. We additionally tried the classification of the breeds on the pre-trained ResNet model that was trained using the imagenet dataset. The training gave us a similar accuracy of about 3-5%.

Additionally, we tried to predict the bounding boxes on the cats and dogs images and found that the bounding box prediction decreases its loss significantly throughout the training however, it does not most accurately predict the boxes as there is fairly little training data for the bounding boxes which leads to overfitting and incorrect learning predictions. However, we only trained it using CNN. We believe that training it over a pre-trained model to predict the bounding boxes may be far more efficient and improve the accuracy of the model.

### Conclusion:

We have tried multiple models, to try to classify whether an input image is of a cat or a dog and models to classify into the different breeds of the image provided. Our methods have ranged from simple convolutional neural networks, to an ensemble of CNNs, as well as multiple pre-trained models for image classification. In addition to classifying for the label, we also attempted to work with trimaps of these input images to make bounding boxes for the images to section off the part of the image that is of the face of the cat/dog to make classification further much easier. Upon further fine-tuning of the models, we should be able to find the cat or dog with the bounding boxes, determine whether it is a cat or a dog and finally, predict the breed of the pet.
