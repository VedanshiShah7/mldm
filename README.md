# Machine learning and data mining
Final project for machine learning and data mining - Pet Dataset Segmentation

- Project proposal [[Here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFd3gYxx48/vUWV_t2ObbldzB7A1JCsnw/edit?utm_content=DAFd3gYxx48&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)]
  - To be able to recognise the pets (between cats and dogs) and their breeds based on the data given.
  - Interesting because:
      - Large and Diverse
      - Challenging
      - Fine-grained Recognition
      - Benchmark
  - Approaches:
      - Since the input data is images, neural networks seems to be the most apt method for classification
      - Specifically Convolutional Neural networks (CNNs) may work best due to the large number of pixels, i.e. data, in the inputs
      - filtering down to reduce the computation is very important and CNNs are able to scale to handle large amounts of data
      - CNNs can also focus on details that are important for classification, and will not get lost due to a large amount of data
      - However, based on the information from the website, we can see that they recommend the use of segmentation and that might be an interesting approach to take
    - Timeline:
      - We aim to finish the data cleaning, preprocessing, repository and model set up in one week
      - Then we will work on creating the CNN and/or segmentation model
      - Then we would have preliminary results by April 12th, in preparation of our presentation sharing our project results
      - This leaves us another two weeks to focus on model validation and fine tuning our results based on feedback from our presentation for the final deadline of April 27th
